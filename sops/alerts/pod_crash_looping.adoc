= ThreescalePodCrashLooping

toc::[]

== Description

* This alert will trigger if a pod is on `CrashLoop` state because one of the containers crashes and is restarted indefinitely

== Troubleshooting

* Check pod logs/events to see the reason of the `CrashLoop`
* Check if maybe container resources requests/limits are too low and OOMKiller is acting (container trying to allocate more memory than permitted)

== Verification

* Alert should disappear once the pod is up and running
