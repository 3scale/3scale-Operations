= ThreescaleContainerCPUHigh

toc::[]

== Description

* This alert will trigger if the cpu usage is being very high

== Troubleshooting

* Check if CPU resources requests/limits are properly set and appropriate to the historical usage data. If the real usage tends to surpass the requested threshold, you may need to increase the container resources
* Check if maybe you need to scale horizontally the associated deployment with more pods (if possible) to distribute the load
- Some deployments **cannot** be scaled horizontally: `backend-cron` and any db (`backend-redis`,`system-redis`, `system-mysql`, `system-memcache`, `system-sphinx`, `zync-database`)

== Verification

* Alert should disappear once CPU usage decreases below the threshold
