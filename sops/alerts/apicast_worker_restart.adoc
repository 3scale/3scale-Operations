= ThreescaleApicastWorkerRestart

toc::[]

== Description

* This alert will trigger if one of the nginx-worker restarted for any reason

== Troubleshooting

* Check why the worker died in the APIcast logs; the usual reasons are:
- Pod hits the memory limits and one of the worker processes was killed. Check why the limits were reached, and if it's needed, increase them
- Node is out of memory, so try to kill containers to schedule to another node

== Verification

* Check that the worker died metric does not increase and memory is under the limits.
