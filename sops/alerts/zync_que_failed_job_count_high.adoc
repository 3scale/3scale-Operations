= ThreescaleZyncQueFailedJobCountHigh

toc::[]

== Description

* This alert will trigger if the number of `zync-que` **failed** jobs is greater than a given threshold
* **Failed** jobs are the ones that failed at least once, did not run out of attempts to retry and therefore are scheduled for retry any time soon

== Troubleshooting

* Check the logs at `zync-que` pods to see the reason of the failures

== Verification

* Alert should disappear once the number of `zync-que` **failed** jobs is below the threshold
