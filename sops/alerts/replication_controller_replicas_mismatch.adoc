= ThreescaleReplicationControllerReplicasMismatch

toc::[]

== Description

* This alert will trigger if a `ReplicationController` does not have the desired number of pods running

== Troubleshooting

* Check if the new pods created by the replicaset might be failing
* Check if there might be an issue with the scheduling due to lack of nodes resources or tolerations

== Verification

* Alert should disappear once all pods are running per `ReplicationController` (running pods = desired pods)
