= ThreescaleApicastHttp4xxErrorRate

toc::[]

== Description

* This alert will trigger if the error rate of `apicast-staging`/`apicast-production` HTTP 4XX requests is greater than a given threshold

== Troubleshooting

* Check if `apicast-staging`/`apicast-production` pods might be failing
* Check `apicast-staging`/`apicast-production` pod logs to see if:
- Auth is not valid
- Service/Mapping rule is not being found (either it does not exists in `system-app` or `system-app` is having issues and not returning the required configuration )
- Upstream is sending a 4XX status code
- Used policy is configured to send 4XX status code


== Verification

* Alert should disappear once the error rate of `apicast-staging`/`apicast-production` HTTP 4XX requests is below the threshold
