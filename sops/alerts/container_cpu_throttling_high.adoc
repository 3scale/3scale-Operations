= ThreescaleContainerCPUThrottlingHigh

toc::[]

== Description

* This alert will trigger if the cpu usage is being throttled (using more resources than configured)

== Troubleshooting

* Check if CPU resources requests/limits are properly set and appropriate to the historical usage data. If the real usage tends to surpass the requested threshold, you may need to increase the container resources

== Verification

* Alert should disappear once CPU usage is stable
