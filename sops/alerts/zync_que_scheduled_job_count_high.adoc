= ThreescaleZyncQueScheduledJobCountHigh

toc::[]

== Description

* This alert will trigger if the number of `zync-que` **scheduled** jobs is greater than a given threshold
* **Scheduled** jobs are the ones that are enqueued to be executed some time in the future, but not now (never failed, nor got expired)

== Troubleshooting

* Check if `zync-que` pods might be failing and the jobs are not being consumed at all from zync's postgres
* Check if `zync-que` pods might not be consuming jobs at the required throughput:
- You may need to consider scaling horinzontally `zync-que` deployment
- You may need to consider increasing `zync-que` deployment resources requests/limits
* Check if zync's postgres is having issues

== Verification

* Alert should disappear once the number of `zync-que` **scheduled** jobs is below the threshold
